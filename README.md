# myfft
### FFT iterative implementation made in C.
Task given at Signals and Systems class (2022.1) at Instituto Federal Fluminense (IFF), ministered by prof. Alexandre Leite.

It's main goals were:
- Implementation of Cooley-Tukey algorithm, calculating the FFT at a radix-2 butterfly sequence of operations.
- Comparison with some scientific computation tool, such as Python, EIGEN, Octave, MATLAB (the one chosen). The subjects were:
  - Numerical analysis (error computation)
  - Temporal analysis (profiling)

My solution was using the iterative mode. You can read more about the development and its results on the PDF article in this repo (written in PT-BR).
